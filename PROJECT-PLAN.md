# Road to PMI: Project Plan and Milestones

A personal web learning platform for PMI certifications, built step by step. This file is the single place to see the plan and where the project stands. It is updated at the end of every session.

## Status log

| Date | What happened | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-09 | Plan approved. This tracker created. | Session 0: install Node.js and Git |
| 2026-10-09 | Isolated environment set up (portable Node.js + Git in `.tools`, Python in `.venv`). Instructor outline read. App skeleton built with first sample module (1.1). Runs on localhost. | You: review the app in the browser. Then Session 2 (GitHub + Vercel) |
| 2026-10-09 | Switched reference to PMBOK 8th edition: module 1.1 rewritten (15 quiz questions, 22 flashcards), Domains 1 and 2 re-planned (38 modules total). Added "Your progress in this module" panel to undo or reset any mark. Local Git repository created with first commit. | You: create GitHub repository and Vercel project (steps in chat). Then Session 3: module 1.2 |
| 2026-10-10 | Visual redesign with the frontend-design plugin: "project schedule" look, exam blueprint strip, milestone diamonds, index-card flashcards, local fonts. Going online is on hold at your request. | You: review the new look. Then either go online (GitHub + Vercel) or Session 3: module 1.2 |
| 2026-10-10 | New plan approved (2 modules per session, a feature after each domain, go online at the end). Session 3 done: modules 1.2 and 1.3 written, content checker added (it caught and fixed unbalanced answer positions in the 1.1 quiz). | You: study and spot-check 1.2 and 1.3. Next: Session 4, modules 1.4 and 1.5 (the 6 principles) |
| 2026-10-10 | Session 4 done: modules 1.4 and 1.5 (the six principles) written. PMI Code of Ethics PDF added to the materials folder by you. | You: study 1.4 and 1.5. Next: Session 5, modules 1.6 and 1.7 (development approaches, focus areas) |
| 2026-10-10 | Session 5 done: modules 1.6 (phases and development approaches) and 1.7 (the five focus areas) written. | You: study 1.6 and 1.7. Next: Session 6, modules 1.8 and 1.9 (performance domains and tailoring; constraints, risks, issues) |
| 2026-10-10 | Session 6 done: modules 1.8 (performance domains and tailoring) and 1.9 (constraints, risks, issues and assumptions) written. | You: study 1.8 and 1.9. Next: Session 7, modules 1.10 and 1.11 (leadership and ethics; 7th edition terms), which completes Domain 1 |
| 2026-10-10 | Session 7 done: modules 1.10 (leadership, emotional intelligence, ethics) and 1.11 (7th edition and Process Groups terms) written. **Domain 1 is complete: 11 of 11 modules.** Process Groups: A Practice Guide added by you and extracted. | You: study 1.10 and 1.11. Next: Session 8, the spaced repetition feature |
| 2026-10-10 | Source links added: every quiz question and every module now lists its book sections, with links that open the PDF from your materials folder at the right page (works on this PC only). Module 1.11 marked with a red * as additional information and removed from progress totals. Session 8 done: spaced repetition for flashcards, with a "Review due cards" session on the home page. | You: click a source link to confirm the PDF opens at the right page; try rating some flashcards. Next: Session 9, Domain 2 modules 2.1 and 2.2 |
| 2026-10-10 | Lesson sources moved: each lesson section now shows its source and PDF link directly under its heading (86 sections across 11 modules). Open question: one of the PDFs asked you for a password. | You: tell me which book and which browser showed the password prompt. Next: Session 9, modules 2.1 and 2.2 |
| 2026-10-10 | Password prompt fixed: Edge cannot open PMI's protected PMBOK PDFs, so the source links now use unlocked local copies (`.cache/pdf/`). The local server also answers byte-range requests properly. | You: click a source link and confirm the book opens at the right page. Next: Session 9, modules 2.1 and 2.2 |
| 2026-10-10 | Session 9 done: Domain 2 started. Modules 2.1 (how predictive projects flow: charter, plan, work performance data, change requests) and 2.2 (the nine Governance processes) written, with a source under every lesson section. | You: study 2.1 and 2.2. Next: Session 10, modules 2.3 (Scope and the WBS) and 2.4 (Schedule) |
| 2026-10-10 | Session 10 done: modules 2.3 (Scope domain: requirements, scope statement, WBS, scope baseline, verified vs accepted deliverables) and 2.4 (Schedule domain: activities, logical relationships, leads and lags, estimating techniques with worked examples) written. | You: study 2.3 and 2.4. Next: Session 11, modules 2.5 (critical path method) and 2.6 (Finance domain) |
| 2026-10-10 | Session 11 done: modules 2.5 (critical path method with a worked forward and backward pass, total and free float, crashing vs fast tracking, resource leveling vs smoothing) and 2.6 (Finance domain: cost estimating, cost of quality, budget build-up, reserves, funding) written. **Domain 2 is half done: 6 of 12 modules.** | You: study 2.5 and 2.6, and work the float example by hand once. Next: Session 12, modules 2.7 (earned value management) and 2.8 (Stakeholders domain) |

## How your progress is saved

- Saved automatically in the browser the moment you click. Closing the browser or shutting down the PC does **not** reset it.
- It is tied to one browser on one device and one address: progress on `localhost` and on the Vercel site are separate, and so are PC and phone. Use **Download backup / Restore from backup** on the home page to move it.
- It is lost only if you clear the browser's site data, or use a private/incognito window.
- Flashcards use spaced repetition. A card you know comes back after 1 day, then 3, 7, 14 and 30 days. A card you miss comes back the same day. The home page shows how many are due and starts a review session across all modules.
- Every mark can be changed: in each module, the "Your progress in this module" panel lets you remove the lesson-completed mark, clear the quiz score, and reset the flashcards. A single flashcard can be re-rated any time.

## Sources and PDF links

- **Lesson:** each section shows its source directly under the section heading, with a link.
- **Quiz:** every explanation shows its source (book, section) with a link.
- **Flashcards and quiz tabs:** a "Sources for this module" list sits below.
- A link opens the PDF from `PMI Learning Material/` in a new browser tab at the page where that section starts. "PDF page" is the page number your PDF viewer shows, not the number printed on the page.
- The links work only when the platform runs on this PC (`start.bat`). The PDFs are licensed to you personally and are never uploaded, so on the future website the same place shows the book and page as plain text.
- Flashcards do not have a page each; they use the module's source list.
- The two PMBOK Guides are protected by PMI in a way the Edge browser cannot open (it asks for a password). The links therefore use unlocked copies stored in `.cache/pdf/`, made by `tools/unlock_pdfs.py` at your request on 2026-10-10. The copies stay on this PC, are excluded from Git, and still carry your name and member ID on each page. Your original files are untouched.
- If a PDF is renamed or a new book is added, update `web/src/content/books.json`, then run `tools/extract_pdf.py` and `tools/unlock_pdfs.py`.
- A red **\*** marks a module as additional information that is not part of the exam (currently only 1.11). It does not count toward progress.

## How to start the app on this PC

Double-click `start.bat` in the project folder. It opens http://localhost:5173 in the browser. Close the black window to stop it.

In a VS Code terminal you can instead run `. .\env.ps1` once, then `cd web` and `npm run dev`.

## Goal

Study for and pass PMI certifications using my own platform, in this order:

1. **CAPM** (Certified Associate in Project Management) - current focus
2. PMP (Project Management Professional)
3. PMI-ACP (Agile Certified Practitioner)
4. PMI-SP (Scheduling Professional)

## Decisions

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Technology | Vite + React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (static web app) |
| Hosting | Localhost first, then Vercel free tier via a private GitHub repository |
| Progress saving | In the browser (localStorage) with export/import backup. Cloud sync later |
| Language | English only |
| Devices | Desktop first, mobile layout after |
| Visual design | Styled like a project schedule. Colors: paper `#F4F6F8`, ink `#14213D`, schedule blue `#2B4FD8` (in progress), green `#1B7F6B` (done), critical red `#C81E3A` (mistakes only), amber `#B97A00` (examples and notes). Fonts: Archivo for the interface, Literata for lesson text, both stored in the project so it works offline. Tokens live in `web/src/index.css` |
| Isolation | Nothing installed in Windows. Node.js and Git are portable copies in `.tools/`, Python libraries in `.venv/`. Deleting the project folder removes everything |
| Book edition | **PMBOK Guide 8th edition is the primary reference** (decided 2026-10-09): 6 principles, 7 performance domains, 5 focus areas. Lessons add a short "edition note" where the 7th edition worded things differently, and module 1.11 bridges the 7th-edition terms (12 principles, 8 domains) that the instructor course and some exam questions may still use |

## Ground rules

- **Copyright:** the site contains only original summaries, quiz questions and flashcards, with chapter references to the PMI books. The PDFs and instructor screenshots stay on this PC and are never uploaded.
- **Token saving:** one module per session. Book text is extracted once to a local cache so each session reads only the pages it needs.
- **Web research:** only for specific facts. If a source is blocked or paywalled, Claude asks instead of forcing access.
- **Pace:** slow and verified. Each session ends with a review before moving on.

## CAPM exam structure

| Domain | Exam weight | Main sources |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Project Management Fundamentals and Core Concepts | 36% | PMBOK Guide |
| 2. Predictive, Plan-Based Methodologies | 17% | PMBOK Guide, WBS / Scheduling / Estimating standards |
| 3. Agile Frameworks / Methodologies | 20% | Agile Practice Guide |
| 4. Business Analysis Frameworks | 27% | PMI Guide to Business Analysis |

Exam format: 150 questions, 3 hours. Checked on 2026-10-09 against several exam-prep sources that agree on these numbers; not yet checked on PMI's own page.

## Roadmap to a complete CAPM course

Agreed on 2026-10-10: **2 modules per session**, **one feature after each domain**, **go online at the end**.

| Status | Session | What | 
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | 3 | Modules 1.2, 1.3 and the content checker |
| ✅ | 4 | Modules 1.4, 1.5: the 6 principles |
| ✅ | 5 | Modules 1.6, 1.7: development approaches, the 5 focus areas |
| ✅ | 6 | Modules 1.8, 1.9: performance domains and tailoring; constraints, risks, issues |
| ✅ | 7 | Modules 1.10, 1.11: leadership and ethics; 7th edition terms. (Code of Ethics PDF is in the materials folder) |
| ✅ | 8 | Feature: spaced repetition for flashcards (plus source links to the PDFs) |
| 🟡 | 9 to 14 | Domain 2: 12 modules (Sessions 9 to 11 done: 2.1 to 2.6) |
| ⬜ | 15 | Feature: dashboard and "practice my weakest topics" quiz |
| ⬜ | 16 to 19 | Domain 3: 8 modules |
| ⬜ | 20 | Feature: study plan and exam countdown |
| ⬜ | 21 to 24 | Domain 4: 7 modules |
| ⬜ | 25 | Feature: timed exam simulator (150 questions, 180 minutes) |
| ⬜ | 26 | UI/UX polish (see backlog below) |
| ⬜ | 27 | Go online: GitHub and Vercel, test on phone |

Every content session ends with the source linker (`tools/link_sources.py`), the content checker (`tools/check_content.py`) and a build passing.

### UI/UX backlog (for Session 26)

- Dark mode
- More interactive buttons and feedback
- Phone-width layout check
- Wide lesson tables (for example the 40-process table in module 1.8) are cramped in the reading column: let wide tables use the full page width

Add ideas here as they come up.
